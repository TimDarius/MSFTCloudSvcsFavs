In Safari:
--------

Short version for now:

Import the favorites file.
Safari will not display icons, so none are included.
Each import of the favorites file will create a date-stamped import folder with all of the folder structure nested below it.
REarrange as needed.

After Import:
-------------

The 'Frequently Used' folder will contain two sub-folders
'Cloud' contains a cloud-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Commercial links are in the Commercial sub-folder
	Frequently Used > Cloud > Commercial > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Cloud > DoD > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

'Service' contains a service-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Power Platform links are in the Power Platform sub-folder and are further grouped by Cloud
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - Commercial <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - DoD <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

Keep whichever grouping is agreeable (Cloud or Service)
Delete whichever grouping is disagreeable (Cloud or Service)
Keep both if you like
