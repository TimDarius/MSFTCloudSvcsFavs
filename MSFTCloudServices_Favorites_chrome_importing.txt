On first import, Chrome may create two extra folders that are not needed:
Imported
  Favorites Bar
    Frequently Used
    Reference
Expand the folders, then drag and drop the 'Frequently Used' and 'Reference' folders to be the first two items in the bookmarks bar, or locate them as you see fit.
Right-click the Imported folder and delete it

Explore the shortcuts contained in the folders.


After Import:
-------------

The 'Frequently Used' folder will contain two sub-folders
'Cloud' contains a cloud-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Commercial links are in the Commercial sub-folder
	Frequently Used > Cloud > Commercial > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Cloud > DoD > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

'Service' contains a service-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Power Platform links are in the Power Platform sub-folder and are further grouped by Cloud
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - Commercial <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - DoD <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

Keep whichever grouping is agreeable (Cloud or Service)
Delete whichever grouping is disagreeable (Cloud or Service)
Keep both if you like
