The 'Frequently Used' folder will contain two sub-folders
'Cloud' contains a cloud-centric view of shortcuts.

	Frequently Used > Cloud > Commercial > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Cloud > DoD > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

'Service' contains a service-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Power Platform links are in the Power Platform sub-folder and are further grouped by Cloud
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - Commercial <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - DoD <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>
