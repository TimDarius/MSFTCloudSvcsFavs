In Firefox:
----------

Click the [hamburger button] in the top right corner > Bookmarks > Manage bookmarks
At the popup window, select [^v Import and Backup] > 'Import bookmarks from HTML...'
Then browse to the 'MSFTCloudServices_Favorites_firefox.html' file

Either double-click the file or select it and click the [Open] button

The Bookmarks have been imported into the Bookmarks Menu, not into the Bookarks toolbar so they won't show yet.
This is by design per mozilla documentation: https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-bookmarks-html-file

Expand the Bookmarks Menu > Bookmarks toolbar
Drag and Drop 'Frequently Used' to the Bookmarks Toolbar
Drag and Drop 'Reference' to the Bookmarks Toolbar
Right-click the Bookmarks Toolbar folder and select 'Delete Folder'
Close the popup window

You may not see anything right away. This depends on other browser settings.

Close and reopen Firefox
The 'Frequently Used' and 'Reference' folders should show in the Bookmarks toolbar

If you do not see the bookmarks toolbar, 
Click the [hamburger button] in the top right corner > Bookmarks > Show bookmarks toolbar

If existing bookmarks already fill up the toolbar, click the [>] button at the right of the toolbar 
and locate the 'Frequently Used' and 'Reference' folders at the end of the list

Drag and Drop the folders to be the first two items in the bookmarks toolbar, or locate them as you see fit.

Explore the shortcuts contained in the folders.


After Import:
-------------

The 'Frequently Used' folder will contain two sub-folders
'Cloud' contains a cloud-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Commercial links are in the Commercial sub-folder
	Frequently Used > Cloud > Commercial > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Cloud > DoD > Power Platform Admin Center <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

'Service' contains a service-centric view of shortcuts. 
	e.g. All Power Platform links are in the Power Platform sub-folder and are further grouped by Cloud
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - Commercial <https://aka.ms/ppac>
	Frequently Used > Service > Power Platform > Power Platform Admin Center - DoD <https://aka.ms/ppacdod>

Keep whichever grouping is agreeable (Cloud or Service)
Delete whichever grouping is disagreeable (Cloud or Service)
Keep both if you like
